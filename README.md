## What would  chatgpt do ?

I asked it to write me a sudoku checker using circom, it replied

Circom is a programming language for creating zero-knowledge circuits. However, checking the results of a sudoku puzzle is a task better suited for a general-purpose programming language like Python, JavaScript, or Java. Circom is not designed to handle tasks like sudoku validation.

If you'd still like to create a program in a more appropriate language to check the results of a sudoku puzzle, please let me know, and I can provide you with an example.
